The intro is :  A  G  D  -  A G D A

[A]Got out of town on a [G]boat goin' to southern is[D]lands
Sailing a [A]reach be[G]fore a following [D]sea.  [A]
[A]She was making for the [G]trades on the [D]outside,
and the [A]downhill run [G]to Pape-ete [D]Bay. [A]

Off the [A]wind on this [G]heading lie the Mar[D]quesas
We got eig[A]hty feet of [G]waterline [D]nicely [Bm]making [A]way
In a [A]noisy bar in [G]Avalon, I tried to [D]call you
But on the [A]midnight watch I [G]realized why [D]twice you [Bm]ran a[A]way.

{comment:Chorus:}

{soc}
[G]Think about [D]how many times I[G] have [A]fallen
[G]Spirits are [D]usin' me; [G]larger voices [A]callin'
[G]What heaven brought [D]you and me [G]cannot be forg[A]otten.

I have been [D]around[G] the [A]world,
[D]looking for that wo[G]man-[A]girl
who [D]knows love [G]can end[A]ure.
And you know it w[A]ill[G].  [D]
[A] [G] [D] [A]
{eoc}


[A]When you see the Southern [G]Cross for the [D]first time,
You [A]understand now [G]why you came this [D]way.[A]
'Cause the [A]truth you might be [G]running from is [D]so small.
But it's as [A]big as the [G]promise, the [D]promise of a [Bm]comin' [A]day.

So I'm [A]sailing for [G]tomorrow. My dreams are [D]a-dying.
And my [A]love is an [G]anchor tied to you, [D]tied with a [Bm]silver [A]chain.
I have my [A]ship, and [G]all her flags are [D]a-flying.
She is [A]all that I have [G]left, and [D]music [Bm]is her [A]name.

Think about...

{comment:Chorus}

So we [A]cheated and we [G]lied and we [D]tested.
And we [A]never failed to [G]fail.  It was the [D]easiest thing to [A]do.
You will sur[G]vive being [D]bested.
Somebody [A]fine will [G]come along, make me [D]forget about [Bm]loving [A]you
and the Southern [A]Cross. [G] [D]
[A] [G] [D]
