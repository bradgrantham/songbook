[Em]        [G]        [D]
[Em]        [G]        [D]

[Em]Two jumps in a week, I bet you th[G]ink that's pretty clever don't [D]you boy?
[Em]Flying on your motorcycle, [G]watching all the ground beneath [D]you drop 
[Em]You'd kill yourself for recognition, [G]kill yourself to never, [D]ever stop  [D]
[Em]You broke another mirror, you're [G]turning into something you [D]are not

[D]Don't leave me [Em]high, [G] don't leave me [D]dry 
[D]Don't leave me [Em]high, [G] don't leave me [D]dry 

[Em]     [G]      [D]

[Em]Drying up in conversation, [G]you'll be the one who can[D]not talk 
[Em]All your insides fall to pieces, [G]you just sit there wishing you could still [D]make love
[Em]They're the ones who'll hate you when you [G]think you've got the world all [D]sussed out
[Em]They're the ones who'll spit on you, [G]you will be the one [D]screaming out 
[D]Don't leave me [Em]high, [G] don't leave me [D]dry 
[D]Don't leave me [Em]high, [G] don't leave me [D]dry 

[Em] (solo)    [G]      [D]
[Em] (solo)    [G]      [D]

Oh, it's the [Em]best thing that you ever had, the [G]best thing that you ever, e[D]ver had. 
It's the [Em]best thing that you ever had, the [G]best thing you have had has go[D]ne away. 

So don't leave me [Em]high, [G] don't leave me [D]dry 
Don't leave me [Em]high, [G] don't leave me [D]dry 
Don't leave me [Em]high, [G] (guitar solo)
Don't leave me [Em]high, [G] don't leave me [D]dry
