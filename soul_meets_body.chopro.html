[Am] [C]
[Am] [C]

[Am]I want to live where [C]soul meets body.
[Am]And let the sun wrap its [C]arms around me and
[Am]bathe my skin in water [C]cool and cleansing and
[G]feel, feel what its like to be [Am]new.

[Am]Cause in my head, there's a [C]greyhound station.
[Am]Where I send my thoughts to [C]far off destinations
[Am]So they may have a chance of [C]finding a place
where they're [G]far more suited than here

[Am]ba da ba [C]da ba [G]bada ba da
[Am]ba ba ba[C]da ba ba [G]ba bada
[Am]ba ba ba[C]da ba [G]bada bada
[Am]ba [C] [G]

[Am] [C] [Am] [C]

[Am]I cannot guess what [C]we'll discover
[Am]We turn the dirt with our [C]arms cupped like shovels
but I [Am]know our filthy hands can [C]wash one another's
and [G]not one speck will remain

{colb}

{comment:Chorus:}

{soc}
[Am]I do be[C]lieve it's [G]true that there are
[Am]roads left in [C]both of our [G]shoes but if the
[Am]silence takes [C]you then I [G]hope it takes me too
[Am] [C] [G]

So [Am]brown eyes I [C]hold you [G]near
'cause you're the [Am]only song I [C]want to [G]hear,
a melo[Am]dy softly [C]soaring [G]through my atmosphere
[Am] [C] [G]
{eoc}

Where soul[Am x5] meets [Am x4]body [C] [C]
[Am x5] [...] [Am x4]
Where soul[Am x5] meets [Am x4]body [C]
Where [G]soul meets body

{comment:Chorus}

[Am]A melody softly [C]soaring [G]through my atmosphere
[Am] [C] [G]
[Am]A melody softly [C]soaring [G]through my atmosphere
[Am] [C] [G]
[Am]A melody softly [C]soaring [G]through my atmosphere
[Am] [C] [G]
