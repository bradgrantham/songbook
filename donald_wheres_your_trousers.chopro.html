[Em]I just down from the Isle of Skye

[Em]All the lassies shout as I go by,  
[D]"Donald, Where's Your Troo[Em]sers?"

[Em]Let the wind blow high and the wind blow low  
[D]Through the streets in my kilt I'll go  
[Em]All the lassies say, "Hello!  
[D]Donald, where's your troosers?" [Em]  
[Em]A Lady took me to a ball  
[D]And it was slippery in the hall  
[Em]I was afeared that I wid fall  
[D]'Cause I had nay on ma troosers  [Em]
 
Chorus 
[Em]Let the wind blow high and the wind blow low

All [Em]the lassies say, "Hello!  
[D]Donald, where's your troosers?" [Em]

[Em]I went down to London town  
[D]To have a little fun in the underground  
[Em]All the Ladies turned their heads around, saying,  
[D]"Donald, where's your troosers?" [Em]
