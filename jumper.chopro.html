[Fmaj7]I wish you would [C]step back from that [G]ledge, my friend.
You could [Fmaj7]cut ties with [C]all the lies that [G]you've been livin' in.
[Fmaj7]And if you do [C]not want to see [G]me again,
I would underst[Fmaj7]a-[C]a-[G]and.
I would underst[Fmaj7]a-[C]a-[G]and.

The [Am]angry boy a bit too insane
[C]icing over a secret pain.
[G]You know you don't belong.

You're the [Am]first to fight.  You're way too loud.
You're the [C]flash of light on a burial shroud.
[G]I know something's wrong.

Well [Am]everyone I know has got a [D9sus2]reason to [C]say
Put the past a[Fmaj7]way.

I wish you would [C]step back from that [G]ledge, my friend.
You could [Fmaj7]cut ties with [C]all the lies that [G]you've been livin' in.
[Fmaj7]And if you do [C]not want to see [G]me again,
I would underst[Fmaj7]a-[C]a-[G]and.
I would underst[Fmaj7]a-[C]a-[G]and.

Well he's [Am]on the table and he's goin' to code.
I do not [C]think anyone knows what they're [G] doin' here.
And your [Am]friends have left you, you've been dismissed.
[C]I never thought it would come to this and I[G], I want you to know.
[Am]Everyone's got to face down the [D9sus2]demons.  Maybe to[C]day you can
Put the past a[Fmaj7]way.

[Fmaj7]I wish you would [C]step back from that [G]ledge, my friend.
You could [Fmaj7]cut ties with [C]all the lies that [G]you've been livin' in.
[Fmaj7]And if you do [C]not want to see [G]me again,
