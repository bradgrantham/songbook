[C]So, so you think you can t[D]ell,
Heaven from H[Am]ell, blue skies from [G]pain.
Can you tell a green [D]field from a cold steel [C]rail, a smile from a [Am]veil,
Do you think you can t[G]ell?

And did they get you to tr[C]ade your heroes for [D]ghosts,
Hot ashes for tr[Am]ees, hot air for a coo[G]l breeze, cold comfort for cha[D]nge,
And did you exchan[C]ge a walk on part in the [Am]war for a lead role in a ca[G]ge?

[Em]    [G]   [Em]    [G]   [Em]    [A]   [Em]    [A]

[C]How I wish, how I wish you were [D]here.
We're just [Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bow[G]l, year after year,  [D]
Running over the same old ground. [C]What have we found?
The same old [Am]fears. Wish you were here! [G]

[Em]    [G]   [Em]    [G]   [Em]    [A]   [Em]    [A]   [G]
