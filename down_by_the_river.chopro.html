[Em7] [A] [Em7] [A]

Verse 1:
[Em7] Be on my side, I'll [A]be on your side, baby
[Em7] There is no reason for [A]you to hide
[Em7] It's so hard for me [A]staying here all alone
[Em7] When you could be taking [A]me for a ride.
[C] Yeah [Bm] yeah,

Chorus:
[C] She could drag me [Bm]over the rainbow,
and [C] send me away[Bm] [D]
[G]  Down [D]by the ri[A]ver
[G]  I [D]shot my ba[A]by
[G]  Down [D]by the ri[A]ver
[Em7]Dead,  [A]  oh, [Em7]  shot her [A]dead.

Verse 2:
[Em7] You take my hand, I'll [A]take your hand
[Em7] Together we may [A]get away
[Em7] This much madness [A]is too much sorrow
[Em7] It's impossible to [A]make it today.
