[D] (intro)

[D]Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
[D]I got the feelin' that something ain't right.
I'm so [G7]scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm [D]wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs.
[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]jokers to the right[G],
here I am [D]stuck in the middle with you.

[D]Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
[D]And I'm wonderin' what it is I should do.
It's so [G7]hard to keep this smile from my face
[D]Losing control, I'm all over the place.
[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]jokers to the right[G],
here I am [D]stuck in the middle with you.

Well you [G7]started out with nothin' and you're
proud that you're a self-made man. [D]
And your [G7]family all come crawlin',
slap you on the back and say
[D]Please... [A7?]Please...

[D]
[D]Tryin' to make some sense of it all,
[D]but I can see it makes no sense at all.
Is it cool[G7] to go to sleep on the floor,
I don't [D]think I can take anymore.
[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]jokers to the right[G],
here I am [D]stuck in the middle with you.

[D]Yeah, I don't know why I came here tonight
[D]I got the feelin' that something ain't right.
I'm so [G7]scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm [D]wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs.
[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]jokers to the right[G],
here I am [D]stuck in the middle with you.
Cause I'm [D]stuck in the middle with you.
    [D]stuck in the middle with you.
Here I am, [D]stuck in the middle with you.
