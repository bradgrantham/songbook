[A](intro riff)
[A] (intro)       [G]      [D]
[A] (intro)       [G]      [D]

[A]I can see why [G]you think [D]you be[A]long to me. [G] [D]
[A]I never tried to [G]make you [D]think or [A]let you see [G]one thing [D]for yourself.
But now you're [C]off with someone else and I'm a[D]lone.
You see I [C]thought that I might keep you for my [E]own.

[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna [D]do?  [A]I think [G]I could stay with [D]you
for a [Bm]while, maybe longer if I [E]do.

[A]     [G]     [D]     [A]     [G]     [D]

[A]Don't you think the [G]time is [D]right for [A]us to find [G] [D]
[A]All the things we [G]thought weren't [D]proper [A]could be right in time, 
And can you [D]see, which way [C]we should turn together or a[D]lone?
I can [C]never see what's right or what is[E] wrong!  (Will it take too long to see?)

[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna [D]do?  [A]I think [G]I could stay with [D]you
for a [Bm]while, maybe longer if I [E]do.

[A]     [G]     [D]     [A]     [G]     [D]

[A] (solo [G] over [D] verse [A] chords) [G]     [D]
[A]     [G]     [D]     [A]     [A]     [A]
[D]     [C]     [E]

[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna [D]do?  [A]I think [G]I could stay with [D]you
for a [Bm]while, maybe longer if I [E]do.

[A]     [G]     [D]

[A]Now it's come to [G]what you [D]want, you've [A]had your way. [G] [D]
And [A]all the things you [G]thought bef[D]ore just [A]faded into gray
And can you [D]see that I [C]don't know if it's you or if it's [D]me.
If it's [C]one of us, I'm sure we both will [E]see.  Won't you look at me and tell me?

[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna [D]do?  [A]I think [G]I could stay with [D]you
for a [Bm]while, maybe longer if I [E]do. (longer if I do!)

[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna [D]do?  [A]I think [G]I could stay with [D]you
for a [Bm]while, maybe longer if I [E]do.

{comment: soft picking:}

I keep [A]falling in and out of [G]love with [D]you.
[A]Falling in and out of [G]love with [D]you.
[A]Don't know what I'm gonna [G]do[D].
I keep [A]falling in and out of [G]love with [Fm]youuuuuuu.
