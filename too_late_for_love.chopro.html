[Em]Somewhere in the distance, [C] I [D]hear the bell ring, [Dsus4]
[D]Darkness settles on the [C]town, as the [Em]children start to sing
And the [Em]lady across the street, [C] [D]she shuts out the night, [Dsus4]
A [D]cast on thousands wait[C]ing, as [Em]she turns out the light, but it's
[Em]Too late, [C] [D]too late, [Dsus4] [D]too late, [C]too [Em]late for love,
[Em]Too late, [C] [D]too late, [Dsus4] [D]too late, [C]too [Em]late...

[Em]London boys are gazing, [C] as [D]girls go hand in hand [Dsus4]
with a [D]pocketful of inno[C]cence, the [Em]entrance is grand
the [Em]queen of the dream, [C] [D]stand before them all [Dsus4]
she [D]streaches out her hand [C] as the [Em]curtain starts to fall, but it's
[Em]Too late, [C] [D]too late, [Dsus4] [D]too late, [C]too [Em]late for love,
[Em]Too late, [C] [D]too late, [Dsus4] [D]too late, [C]too [Em]late!

(Bridge) [Em]Woah oh oh [C]Oh oh oh oh (x2)

[Em]Standing by the trap door, [C] a[D]ware of me and you [Dsus4]
The [D]actor and the clown, [C]they're [Em]waiting for their cue
And there's a [Em]lady over there, [C] she's [D]acting pretty cool [Dsus4]
But [D]when it comes to playing [C]life, she [Em]always plays the fool, but it's
[Em]Too late, [C] [D]too late, [Dsus4] [D]too late, [C]too [Em]late for love,
[Em]Too late, [C] [D]too late, [Dsus4] [D]too late, [C]too [Em]late!
