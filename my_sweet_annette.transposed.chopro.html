I [F]never ever noticed her [C]best friend Marilee.


Took a [Gm]job at the saw mill and I [B]bought my girl a ring,
Had a [F]pre-wedding party, close [C]friends and family.

I [F]swear I never noticed maid of [C]honor, Marilee

[Gm]Marilee was taken ill, it was [B]several miles from home.
Back [F]then it wasn't fittin' for a [C]girl to leave alone.
[Gm]sweet Annette, she asked me to [B]walk her to the door,
As [F]innocent as children back be[C]fore the war.

Chorus 

[Am]Lord have mercy for [B]what we done.
[F]Lord have mercy when two [C]people get alone.

By the [F]next sunset, I had el[Dm]oped with Marilee, 
By the [F]next sunset, I had el[Dm]oped with Marilee, 
By the [F]next sunset, I had el[Dm]oped with Marilee,
