[C]She don’t like her eggs all runny
[C]She thinks crossin’ her legs is funny
[F]She looks down her nose at money
[C]She gets it on like the Easter Bunny
[G]She’s my baby, I’m her honey
Never gonna let her [C]go

[C]He ain’t been laid in a month of Sundays
[C]Caught him once and he was sniffin’ my undies
[F]Ain’t too sharp but he gets things done
[C]Drinks his beer like it’s oxygen
[G]He’s my baby, I’m his honey
Never gonna let him [C]go

In spite of our[F]selves, we’ll end up sittin’ on a [C]rainbow.
Against all [G]odds, honey we’re the big door [C]prize.
We’re gonna [F]spite our noses right off of our [C]faces.
There won’t be nothin’ but big ol’ [G7]hearts dancin’ in our [C]eyes.

[C]She thinks all my jokes are corny
[C]Convict movies make her horny
[F]She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
[C]Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs
[G]She takes a lickin’, and keeps on tickin’
Never gonna let her [C]go

[C]He’s got more balls than a big brass monkey
[C]He’s a wacked-out weirdo and a love bug junkie
[F]Sly as a fox, crazy as a loon
[C]Payday comes and he’s a-howlin’ at the moon
[G]He’s my baby, don’t mean maybe
Never gonna let him [C]go

In spite of our[F]selves, we’ll end up sittin’ on a [C]rainbow.
Against all [G]odds, honey we’re the big door [C]prize.
We’re gonna [F]spite our noses right off of our [C]faces.
There won’t be nothin’ but big ol’ [G7]hearts dancin’ in our [C]eyes.
