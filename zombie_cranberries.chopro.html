Intro(x4): [Em] [C] [G] [D/F#]

[Em]Another he[C]ad hangs lowly,
Chi[G]ld is slowly ta[D/F#]ken
And the [Em]violence ca[C]used such silence.
[G]Who are we mista[D/F#]ken
But you [Em]see, it's not me,
it's not [C]my family.
In your [G]head, in your head,
they are figh[D/F#]ting

With their [Em]tanks, and their bombs,
and their [C]bombs, and their guns
In your [G]head, in your head they are cr[D/F#]yin'

In your [Em]head, In your [C]head,
Zom[G]bie, Zombie, Zom[D/F#]bie, ie, ie
What's in your [Em]head in your [C]head,
Zom[G]bie, Zombie, Zom[D/F#]bie, ie, ie, ie
[Em]Ooh do do do do do [C]do do do do do
[G]do do do do do [D/F#]do do do do do

{colb}
[Em]Another [C]mother's breakin'
[G]heart is taking o[D/F#]ver
When the [Em]violence ca[C]uses silence
[G]we must be mista[D/F#]ken
It's the [Em]same old theme since [C]1916,
in your [G]head, in your head they're still figh[D/F#]tin'

With their [Em]tanks, and their bombs,
and their [C]bombs, and their guns
In your [G]head, in your head they are dy[D/F#]ing

In your [Em]head, In your [C]head,
Zom[G]bie, Zombie, Zom[D/F#]bie, ie, ie
What's in your [Em]head in your [C]head,
Zom[G]bie, Zombie, Zom[D/F#]bie, ie, ie, ie
[Em]Ooh oh oh oh [C]oh oh oh oh
[G]ah ah-ye-ah [D/F#]ah
