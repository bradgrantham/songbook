[A]Did she make you cry? [G]Make you break down? [C]Shatter your illusions of [D]love?
[A]Is it over now? [G]Do you know how? [C]To pick up the pieces and go ho[D]me...

[D]Rock on ancient [G]queen, [C]follow those who [G]pale in your sha[D]dow...

Chrous x2 w/ variation in second:'illusions of love now tell me is it...'

#The lyrics are correct(out of the CD cover) so no problems there, but
#again singing the first little bit is weird as it changes each verse...
#A cool tune nonetheless....
