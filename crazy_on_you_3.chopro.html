We may [Am]still have time, we might [C/G]still get by.

My [Am]love is the evening breeze [C/G]touching your skin,
the [Dm]gentle sweet singing of [E]leaves in the wind.
The [Am]whisper that calls after [C/G]you in the night,
and [Dm]kisses your ear in the [E]early light.    [Am]   [Am]   [Dsus2]    [Am]   [Am]   [Dsus2]

{colb}
[F#m]While the man's world is [D]cryin' in shame
[C#m]What're you going to do when every[D]body's insane?
[C#m]So afraid of wonder, so [D]afraid of you,
What-cha [C#m]gonna do -o[Bm]o- -oo-? [Bm]
[A]Oh...    [A]

[Am]Crazy on [F]you
Let me go [Am]crazy crazy on [G]you        [F]

[Am]I was a willow last [C/G]night in my dream,
I [Dm]bent down over a [E]clear running stream
I [Am]sang you a song that I he[C]ard up above,
and you [Dm]kept me alive with your [E]sweet flowing love.
