[G]Mister pull up a chair
[D]I've got time for tears
[Em]So tell me all the stories that you never [C]did. [D]

[G]Of the salty south,
[D]the Seminoles held out,
[Em]while Geronimo died in a lonely [C]jail. [D]

[C]A thousand tides,
[G]A thousand waves,
[Bm]Takin' it all aw[C]ay. [D]  

[G]It'll come back in, but
[D]We'll be gone by then, and it's a
[Em]miracle we ever learned to [C]live. [D]

[G]Drained that land
[D]For a better plan
[Em]Sugar cane and the civil [C]man. [D]

And now they're
[G]ringing dead them pines
[D]Planted in that time
[Em]They gonna keep on killing 'til they get it [C]right. [D]

(softer) [G]I remember the wind
[D]As it was settlin', and every
