Intro:  [Am] [Dsus2] [Fmaj7] [G]

[Am]  Is it getting bett[Dsus2]er,            [Fmaj7]  or do you feel the [G]same?
[Am]  Will it make it e[Dsus2]asier on you now     [Fmaj7]  You've got someone to [G]blame? 

You say,[C] one love,[Am] one life,[Fmaj7] when it's one need[C] in the night

[C] One love,[Am] we get to share it, it[Fmaj7] leaves you baby if you[C] don't care for it

[Am]  Did I disap[Dsus2]point you,[Fmaj7] or leave a bad taste in your [G]mouth?

[Am]  You act like you never [Dsus2]had love,  [Fmaj7]  and you want me to go with[G]out. 

Well it's[C] too late[Am] tonight[Fmaj7]  to drag the past out in[C]to the light

We're [C]one, but we're [Am]not the same, we get to [Fmaj7]carry each other,

[C]carry each other.  One....

[Am]   Have you come here for for[Dsus2]giveness? [Fmaj7]  Have you come to raise the [G]dead?
[Am]   Have you come here to play [Dsus2]Jesus          [Fmaj7]  to the lepers in your [G]head?
[C] Did I ask too much?[Am]  More than a lot? [Fmaj7]  You gave me nothing, now it's[C] all I got

We're [C]one but we're [Am]not the same, well we [Fmaj7] hurt each other

Then we [C]do it again, you say

[C]  Love is a temple, [Am]love a higher law.[C]  Love is a temple, [Am]love a higher law.

You [C]ask me to enter, but [G]then you make me crawl

And I[G] can't be holding on[F] to what you got,[F] when all you got is hurt
[C] One love,[Am]  one blood, [Fmaj7]  one life, you got to [C]do what you should

[C] One life,[Am] with each other,[Fmaj7] sisters,[C] brothers

[C] One life, but we're[Am] not the same, we get [Fmaj7]to carry each other,

Car[C]ry each other, one....
