{t:Folsom Prison Blues}
{st:Johnny Cash}

I [F]hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,
And [F]I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know [F7]when,
I'm [A#7]stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' [F]on.
But that [C7]train keeps a-rollin' on down to San An[F]tone.

When [F]I was just a baby, my momma told me, "Son,
Always be a good boy; don't ever play with [F7]guns."
But I [A#7]shot a man in Reno, just to watch him [F]die.
When I [C7]hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and [F]cry.

I [F]bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car.
They're [F]prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big ci[F7]gars,
But I [A#7]know I had it comin', I know I can't be [F]free,
But those [C7]people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures [F]me.

Well if they [F]freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,
I [F]bet I'd move it all a little farther down the [F7]line,
[A#7]Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I'd want to [F]stay,
And I'd [C7]let that lonesome whistle blow my blues [F]away.
