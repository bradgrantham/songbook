{t:Folsom Prison Blues}
{st:Johnny Cash}

I [G]hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,
And [G]I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know [G7]when,
I'm [C7]stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' [G]on.
But that [D7]train keeps a-rollin' on down to San An[G]tone.

When [G]I was just a baby, my momma told me, "Son,
Always be a good boy; don't ever play with [G7]guns."
But I [C7]shot a man in Reno, just to watch him [G]die.
When I [D7]hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and [G]cry.

I [G]bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car.
They're [G]prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big ci[G7]gars,
But I [C7]know I had it comin', I know I can't be [G]free,
But those [D7]people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures [G]me.

Well if they [G]freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,
I [G]bet I'd move it all a little farther down the [G7]line,
[C7]Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I'd want to [G]stay,
And I'd [D7]let that lonesome whistle blow my blues [G]away.
