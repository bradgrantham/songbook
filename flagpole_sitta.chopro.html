[D]I had visions I was in them
I was looking into the [Am]mirror
To see a little bit [C]clearer,
the rottenness and evil in [D]me
My [D]fingertips have memories
I can't forget the curves of your [Am]body
And when I feel a bit [C]naughty,
I run it up the flagpole and [D]see
who salutes, but no one ever does.

[D]I'm not sick but I'm not [Am]well,
and I'm so [C]hot, cause I'm in [D]hell

[D]Been around the world and found
that only stupid people are [Am]breeding
The cretins cloning and [C]feeding,
and I don't even own a [D]TV
[D]Put me in the hospital for nerves
and then they had to [Am]commit me
You told them all I was [C]crazy,
they cut off my legs now
[D]I'm an amputee god damn you

[D]I'm not sick but I'm not [Am]well,
and I'm so [C]hot, cause I'm in [D]hell
{colb}
[D]I'm not sick but I'm not [Am]well,
and it's a [C]sin, to live so [D]well

[A]I wanna publish [G]'zines,
and rage against ma[F]chines
I wanna [G]pierce my tongue,
it doesn't hurt, it feels[A] fine
The trivial sub[G]lime,
I'd like to turn off [F]time
and kill my [A]mind...
you kill my [D]mind... mind...

[D]Paranoia, paranoia,
everybody's comin' to [Am]get me
Just say you never [C]met me,
I'm running underground with the [D]moles 
digging holes

[D]Hear the voices in my head -
I swear to god it sounds like they're [Am]snoring
But if you're bored then you're [C]boring,
the agony and the [D]irony they're killing me...well

[D]I'm not sick but I'm not [Am]well,
and I'm so [C]hot, cause I'm in [D]hell
[D]I'm not sick but I'm not [Am]well,
and it's a [C]sin, to live so [D]well
