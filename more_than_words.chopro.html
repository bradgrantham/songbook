[G] Sayin' I [Cadd9]love you is [Am7]not the words I [C]want to [D]hear [Dsus4]from
[G] you.  It's not that I [Cadd9]want you [Am7]not to say but [C]if you [D]on[Dsus4]ly
[Em] knew how [Am7]easy [D7]it would be to [G]show me [D]how [Dadd2]you [Em]feel.
More than [Am7]words is [D7]all you have to [G7]do to make it [C]real
then you [Cm]wouldn't have to [G]say that you [Em7]love me
cause [Am7]I'd al[D7]ready [G]know.

What would you [D]do if my [Em]heart was [Bm]torn in [C]two
More than words to show [G]you [Am7]feel that your [D7]love for me is [G]real
What would you [D]say if I [Em]took those [Bm]words [C]away
then you couldn't make [G]things [Am7]new
just by [D7]saying I love [G]you

[G] [Cadd9]La de da la de [Am7]da de da de dye dye [C]da
[D]More [Dsus4]than [G]words
[Cadd9] La de da [Am7] [D7] [G]

Now that I've [Cadd9]tried to [Am7]talk to you and [C]make you [D]un[Dsus4]der[G]stand
All you [Cadd9]have to do is [Am7]close your eyes and [C]just reach [D]out [Dsus4]your [Em]hand
and [Am7]touch me.
[D7]Hold me close don't [G]ever [D]let me [Em]go
More than [Am7]words is [D7]all you have to [G7]do to make it [C]real
then you [Cm]wouldn't have to [G]say that you [Em7]love me
cause [Am7]I'd al[D7]ready [G]know.

What would you [D]do if my [Em]heart was [Bm]torn in [C]two
More than words to show [G]you [Am7]feel that your [D7]love for me is [G]real
What would you [D]say if I [Em]took those [Bm]words [C]away
then you couldn't make [G]things [Am7]new
just by [D7]saying I love [G]you

[G] [Cadd9]La de da la de [Am7]da de da de dye dye [C]da
[D]More [Dsus4]than [G]words
[G] [Cadd9]La de da la de [Am7]da de da de dye dye [C]da
[D]More [Dsus4]than [G]words
[G] [Cadd9]La de da la de [Am7]da de da de dye dye [C]da
