[G]One night in Iowa,
he and I in a borrowed car.
[Em]Went driving in the summer,
promises in every star.
[C]Out in the distance, I could
hear some people laughing.
[Am]I felt my heart beat back
a weekend's worth of sadness.

[G]There was a farmhouse
that had long since been deserted.
[Em]We stopped and carved our hearts
into the wooden surface.
[C]We thought just for an instant
we could see the future.
[Am]We thought for once we knew
what really was important.

Chorus part 1:
[G]Coming up [C]close. Everything sounds like
'Welcome [G]Home'. Come [C]home.
{colb}
Chorus part 2:
And oh, by the [G]way -
[Em]Don't you know that I could make
a [Am]dream that's barely half-awake
come [C]true.
I [C]wanted to [G]say -
but [Em]anything I could have said
I [Am]felt somehow that you already
[C]knew.

[G]We got back in the car
and listened to a Dylan tape.
[Em]We drove around the fields
until it started getting late,
[C]and I went back to my hotel room
on the highway,
[Am]and he just got back in his car
and drove away.
