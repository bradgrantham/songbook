[A]Yesterday I[Dmaj7] got so old [A]I felt like I could [D]die
[A]Yesterday I[D] got so old [A]it made me wanna cr[D]y

[A]Go on go on just [D]walk away
[A]Go on go on your [D]choice is made
[A]Go on go on and [D]disappear
[A]Go on go on a[D]way from here

And I [Bm9]know I was wrong when I [E]said it was true
That it [Bm]couldn't been me and with [E]her in between without [A]you

[A]Yesterday I[Dmaj7] got so scared I[A] shivered like a chil[D]d
[A]Yesterday a[D]way from you [A]it froze me deep insid[D]e

[A]Come back come back don't [D]walk away
[A]come back come back come [D]back today
[A]come back come back why can't [D]you see
[A]come back come back come back [D]to me

And I [Bm9]know I was wrong when I [E]said it was true
That it [Bm]could've been me and with [E]her in between without [A]you
