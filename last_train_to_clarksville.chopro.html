[G7]Take the last train to Clarksville
[G7]and I'll meet you at the station
[G7]You can be here by four-thirty
[G7]'cause I've made your reservation
Don't be [C7]slow, oh no-no-no, oh no-no-no...

(break)

[G7]'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning,
[G7]and I must see you again.
[G7]We'll have one more night together
[G7]'til the morning brings my train.
and I must [C7]go, oh no-no-no, oh no-no-no...

[G7]all alone
I'm feeling [C7] low
oh no-no-no, oh no-no-no...

(break)

[D7]And I don't know if I'm ever comin' home.
