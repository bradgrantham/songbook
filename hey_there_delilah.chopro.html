INTRO
[D] [F#m] [D] [F#m]

VERSE 1
[D]Hey there Delilah, What's it [F#m]like in New York City? 
I'm a [D]thousand miles away, But girl to[F#m]night you look so pretty, 
Yes you [Bm]do, [G]Time Square can't [A]shine as bright as [Bm]you, 
I swear it's [A]true. 
[D]Hey there Delilah, Don't you [F#m]worry about the distance, 
I'm right [D]there if you get lonely, Give this [F#m]song another listen, 
Close your [Bm]eyes, [G]Listen to my [A]voice it's my dis[Bm]guise, 
I'm by your [A]side. 

CHORUS
[D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, 
[D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, 
What you do to [D]me. 

VERSE 2
[D]Hey there Delilah, I know [F#m]times are getting hard, 
But just be[D]lieve me girl some day, I'll pay the [F#m]bills with this guitar,
We'll have it [Bm]good, [G]We'll have the [A]life we knew we [Bm]would, 
My word is [A]good. 

[D]Hey there Delilah, I've got [F#m]so much left to say, 
If every [D]simple song I wrote to you, Would [F#m]take your breath away, 
I'd write it [Bm]all, [G]Even more in [A]love with me you'd [Bm]fall, 
We'd have it [A]all. 
{colb}

CHORUS
[D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, 
[D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, 

Bridge
[G]A thousand miles seems pretty far, But
[A]they've got planes and trains and cars,
[D]I'd walk to you if I had no other [Bm]way
[G]Our friends would all make fun of us, And
[A]we'll just laugh along because, 
We [D]know that none of them have felt this [Bm]way,
[G]Delilah I can promise you, That [A]by the time that we get through, 
The [Bm]world will never ever be the same, And you're to [A]blame. 

VERSE 3
[D]Hey there Delilah you be [F#m]good, And don't you miss me,
Two more [D]years and you'll be done with school, And
[F#m]I'll be making history, 
[Bm]Like I do, [G]You'll know it's [A]all because of [Bm]you, 
[G]We can do what[A]ever we want [Bm]to, 
[G]Hey there De[A]lilah here's to [Bm]you, This one's for [A]you. 

FINAL CHORUS
[D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me,
[D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it's what you do to [Bm]me,
What you do to [D]me.

[Bm] [D] [Bm] [D] [Bm] [D] [Bm] [D] [D]
Ohhh
