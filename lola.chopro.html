{comment:Intro:}

 [C]       [D]       [E]
                                               
I m[E]et her in a club down in old Soho
Where you [A]drink champagne and it [D]tastes just like cherry [E]cola  C-O-L-A [A]cola [Asus4]
She [E]walked up to me and she asked me to dance 
I [A]asked her her name and in a [D]dark brown voice she said  
[E]Lola  L-O-L-A [A]Lola [D]La la la la [C]Lo - la  [D]      [E]

Well [E]I'm not the world's most physical guy, 
but when she [A]squeezed me tight she nearly [D]broke my spine. 
Oh my [E]Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo [A] Lola
[E]Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand 
why she [A]walked like a woman, but [D]talked like a man.
[E]Oh my Lola, La La La La [A]Lola, [D]La La La La [C]Lola [D] [E]

Well we dr[B]ank champagne and danced all night 
[F#7]under electric candle light 
She [A]picked me up and sat me on her knee and
[A] said "dear boy won't you [A7]come home with me?" 

Well, [E]I'm not the world's most passionate guy, 
but when I [A]looked in her eyes, well I [D]almost fell for my 
[E]Lola, La La La La [A]Lola, [D]La La La La [C]Lola [D]
[E]Lola, La La La La [A]Lola, [D]La La La La [C]Lola [D] [E]

I [A]pushed [C#m]her a[B]way I [A]walked [C#m]to the [B]door  I [A]fell [C#m]to the [B]floor 
I got [E]down [G#m]on my [C#m]knees Then [B]I looked at her and she at [B13]me  
  
[E]Well, that's the way that I wanted to stay... 
I [A]always wanted to [D]be that way for my
[E]Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo [A]Lola
[E]Girls will be boys and boys will be girls, 
It's a [A] mixed up, muddled up, [D]shook up world,
Except for [E]Lola La Lo La La [A]Lola

Well, [B]I'd left home just a week before,
And [F#7]I'd never ever kissed a woman before.
[A]Lola smiled and took me by the hand, 
Said dear boy, gonna [A7]make you a man.

[E]Well I'm not the world's most masculine man, 
But I [A]know what I am, I'm a [D]man, I'm a man, so is [E]Lola.
[E]Lola, La La La La [A]Lola, [D]La La La La [C]Lola [D]
[E]Lola, La La La La [A]Lola, [D]La La La La [C]Lola [D]
