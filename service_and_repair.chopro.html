[Am]On the [F]outskirts [E7sus4] of ex[Am]pansion
[Am]Looking [F]out from Blue[E7sus4]print Peak [E7]
[Am]The flow is [F]flooding [E7sus4] of urban [Am]settlers
[Am]Panning [G]through [F]rivers [E7sus4]running [Am]dry

[F]Numbers roll on [C]in,     [G]smiling a lottery [Am]grin
As [F]sadness blurs the [C]eye
It's just a matter of [Dm]time [Bb] in the moving [C]on
It's just a matter of [Dm]time [Bb] before the moving [C]on
Doesn't take much [Dm]time for [Bb]plans to go [C]wrong
Chase another [Dm]ghost of a [Bb]chance
 
[Am]In the [F]shadows of [E7sus4] chainstore [Am]ghost towns
Where no one [F]walks the  streets [Esus4]at         night [E7]
[Am]The silent [F]nation [E7sus4]hooked on medi[Am]cation
Am]Stares [G]into a [F]blue [E7sus4]flickering [Am]light

The [F]young drift off a[C]lone and the [G]old waste a[Am]way
And the [F]prospects keep looking [C]up
But the line is getting [Dm]long [Bb]on the lost high[C]way

{colb}
The line's getting [Dm]longer [Bb]on the lost high[C]way
Doesn't take much [Dm]time [Bb]for plans to go [C]astray
Chase another [Dm]ghost of a [Bb]chance


(instrumental)
like verse

They [F]say deep down [C]inside
Lie [G]properties of a healing [Am]kind
If [F]so, better come around[C] soon

Do a little bit of [Dm]service [Bb]and re[C]pair
Do a little bit of [Dm]service [Bb]and re[C]pair
Do a little more  [Dm]service [Bb]and re[C]pair
Doesn't take much [Dm]time for [E7]plans to [F]change

[Fm]And offer up [C]another [G]chance
For a [C]little bit more  [Dm]service [Bb]and re[C]pair 
A little bit more  [Dm]service [Bb]and [C]repair
Doesn't take much [Dm]time for [E7]plans to [F]change
[Fm]And offer up [C]another [G]chance
At [Fm]sowing the [C]dreams that [G]suited for
[F]both soul and [C]soil
