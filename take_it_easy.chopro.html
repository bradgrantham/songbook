Well, I'm a-[G]runnin' down the road
tryin' to loosen my load,
I've got seven women [D]on my [C]mind.
[G]Four that want to own me,
[D]two that want to stone me,
[C]one says she's a friend of [G]mine.

Take it [Em]easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy (ooo)
Lighten up while you still can,
don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand,
and take it easy.

Well I'm standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.
Such a fine sight to see.
It's a girl my lord in a flat bed Ford,
Slwoing' to take a look at me.

Come on baby, don't say maybe.
I've got to know if your sweet love is gonna save me.
We may loose and we may win,
but we will never be here again.
So open up, I'm climbin' in.
So take it easy.

Well, I'm a-runnin' down the road
tryin' to loosen my load,
Got a world of trouble on my mind.
Lookin for a lover who won't blow my cover,
She's so hard to find.


Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy (ooo)
Come on baby, don't say maybe.
I've got to know if your sweet love is gonna sa-ave me.
